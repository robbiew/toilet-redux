TOILET STALL -- Version 1.0 -- is released!
===========================================

Toilet Stall is a grafitti wall door with a new twist. Your posts are
displayed in the bowl of a toilet! When you display the next post, the
previous one is flushed to the sewer!

At only $5 registration, this door is a bargain.

Toilet Stall offers the following sysop features (and more I've probably
overlooked in these docs):

-  As you would expect, Toilet Stall monitors carrier detect functions, 
   to automatically recover when a user drops carrier.                    
                                                                       
-  Includes a fully-adjustable inactivity timeout monitor. A warning is
   sent 15 seconds before the caller is ejected.

-  Share-aware file i/o for use in multi-node BBS systems. You must have 
   DOS's SHARE.EXE loaded for multi-node use.             

-  Supports most popular BBS door information files, such as DORINFO1.DEF,
   EXITINFO.BBS, CHAIN.TXT, DOOR.SYS, etc.  

-  Displays and updates a QuickBBS-style status line, with information 
   available to the sysop such as user name, location, baud rate, time left, 
   function keys, ANSI and AVATAR settings, and so on.
   
-  Keeps track of a user "wants-chat" indicator, just like the one in
   RemoteAccess, QuickBBS and other BBS systems. Allows for sysop page from
   the door, and integrated chat mode.

-  Provides the sysop with all the standard function keys for adjusting user 
   time, hanging up on or even locking out the user -- and sysop shell to DOS.

-  Full support for locked baud-rates of up to 115200 baud, using the FOSSIL 
   driver for maximum compatibility with any system. If a FOSSIL is not
   available, Toilet Stall will use its own communications routines. Auto-
   detect of local operation. 

-  Toilet Stall is also DesqView and Windows aware. 

-  Supports non-standard comm ports!

-  Free upgrades!
                                    
-  CONFIGURATION FILE SYSTEM makes it easier to set up and run!
 
-  LOCAL MODE for testing!
 
-  Sysop CHAT and paging!
         
-  Status-line MULTIPLE PERSONALITY SYSTEM. TOILET STALL status line 
   mimics that of your favorite BBS!
     
-  SESSION LOGGING capability.
 
-  Set DIFFERENT PAGING HOURS for each day of the week!
 
-  Configurable PAGE DURATION, TRANSMIT/RECEIVE BUFFER sizes, FIFO BUFFER 
   trigger.
   
-  Supports CUSTOM DROP FILE FORMATS!
