                              QUICK START
                              ===========
                                         
See the file QUICK_ST.ART for fast instructions on how to test and set up
Toilet Stall

      
                                OVERVIEW 
                                ========
                              
I'll freely admit it -- I was inspired to write Toilet Stall by an article in a 
magazine. There were even some code snippets, but in another language. As I 
wrote it, more and more ideas for improvements came to mind, so they were 
incorporated. The final product, I feel is as good as any grafitti wall door 
I've seen -- and at only $5 is a bargain in shareware.

Toilet Stall offers the following sysop features (and more I've probably
overlooked in these docs):

-  As you would expect, Toilet Stall monitors carrier detect functions, to
   automatically recover when a user drops carrier.                    
                                                                       
-  Includes a fully-adjustable inactivity timeout monitor. A warning is
   sent 15 seconds before the caller is ejected.

-  Share-aware file i/o for use in multi-node BBS systems. You must have 
   DOS's SHARE.EXE loaded for multi-node use.             

-  Supports most popular BBS door information files, such as DORINFO1.DEF,
   EXITINFO.BBS, CHAIN.TXT, DOOR.SYS, etc.  

-  Displays and updates a QuickBBS-style status line, with information 
   available to the sysop such as user name, location, baud rate, time left, 
   function keys, ANSI and AVATAR settings, and so on.
   
-  Keeps track of a user "wants-chat" indicator, just like the one in
   RemoteAccess, QuickBBS and other BBS systems. Allows for sysop page from
   the door, and integrated chat mode.

-  Provides the sysop with all the standard function keys for adjusting user 
   time, hanging up on or locking out the user -- and sysop shell to DOS.

-  Full support for locked baud-rates of up to 115200 baud, using the FOSSIL
   driver for maximum compatibility with any system. If a FOSSIL is not
   available, Toilet Stall will use its own communications routines. Support
   for non-standard comm ports, and auto-detect of local operation.

-  Toilet Stall is also DesqView and Windows aware. It will automatically check 
   for the presence of a multitasker, and if available, will perform all of 
   its screen output through the appropriate function calls.

-  Integrated chat, simple configuration, "multiple personality" system,
   session logging, paging hours, Hall of Fame, supports CUSTOM DROP FILE
   FORMATS, and MORE!
   
 
                          COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
                          =======================
                                                    
Most configuration is done via the configuration file. See the TOILET1.CFG
file for an example and instructions on how to edit the paths and other
parameters for your own use. If running multi-node, you'll normally need to
create a separate config file for each node running the door.

Call the program with the following syntax:

TOILET STALL <cfgfile>

Where:

<cfgfile> REQUIRED: Name of the config file. Include the path, if necessary.
          The config file used will normally vary depending on the node
          using the door. I usually set things up so the node number is
          passed on the menu item command line, something like this:
                              
                C:\BBS\DOORS\TOILET.EXE C:\BBS\DOORS\TOILET*N.CFG
                
          The *N parameter is a 'metacharacter' that the BBS software uses
          to provide the node number to the door. This allows you to set up
          a single menu item that will run the program for all nodes without
          resorting to batch files.

Examples:
-------- 

   TOILET TOILET1.CFG
   
         Bring up the door with the node 1 config file. Note that this command
         assumes that you have already changed to the directory containing the
         executable and config files; so it's probably only suitable for use
         in a batch file for node 1.
                                    
   C:\BBS\DOORS\TOILET.EXE C:\BBS\DOORS\TOILET*N.CFG
   
         Run the door from node 2. This example uses the BBS metacharacter to
         select the appropriate config file for each node automatically. This
         command can therefore be placed directly into the BBS menu item. Once
         edited with your own directory paths, the example above should work
         for QuickBBS, RemoteAccess, and clones. Note that most BBS software
         will NOT allow you to omit the .EXE extension.
          
   C:\BBS\DOORS\TOILET
   
         ERROR. Config file name is REQUIRED.
         

What could be simpler?


                         OTHER COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
                         ==========================
                                                  
You MUST be in the Toilet Stall directory to use this option!


   TOILET LOCAL            (Local mode)
   
         Runs Toilet Stall with sysop defaults. This mode does not require
         a configuration file or any door information (drop) files. It's
         mainly used to play with the door a little to see if you like it
         prior to setting it up.
                              

                      CARE AND FEEDING OF TOILET STALL
                      ================================
                                            
Until registered, the sysop may have to go into the door and manually delete 
old posts when the database gets full. If you register, however, you can use
the "Wrap" config file verb, which takes care of old posts "automagically."
The door will create and update the TOILET.BBS file to store data it needs.


                              SYSOP FUNCTIONS
                              ===============
                              
Status Line - The status line lists the name of the user currently on-line, 
his location, and baud rate (0 if the door is operating in local mode). You 
may also find out how much time the user has left,  check for indicators as 
to whether the user has ANSI and/or AVATAR modes on, etc. If the user wants 
to Chat with the sysop (ie: they have paged the sysop, but haven't received
a response), a "Want-Chat" indicator will flash on the status line. 
                                                         
The appearance of the status line varies with the "personality" setting
chosen in the config file. The following is for the "Remote Access" style,
but the other styles are similar.
 
[F1]..[F10] - The Function keys [F1] thru [F10] allows the sysop access to 
              various types of information on the status line, or to turn 
              the status line off. These keys are as follows:

              [F1] -  Display basic door and user information
              [F2] -  Display phone numbers and important dates
              [F3] -  Display security flags and up/download info
              [F4] -  Display system information and current time
              [F5] -  Display message info and user's settings
              [F6] -  Display chat reason and sysop's comment
              [F9] -  Display help information for sysop
              [F10] - Turn off the status line                               
              
The following other function keys are also available to the sysop:

[UP]/[DOWN] - Use these arrow keys to increase or decrease the amount of 
              time the caller has left in the door.

[Alt]-[C] -   Allows the sysop to break into chat with the caller at any 
              time. [Alt]-[C] again, or [ESC] will end chat mode. (Notice 
              that the Want-Chat indicator will also be turned off, if it 
              was flashing). If your door is running under Apex, Remote
              Access or QuickBBS, paging from within the door will also
              cause the Want-Chat indicator to stay lit when the user 
              returns to the BBS.

[Alt]-[J] -   Allows the sysop to shell to DOS, if enough memory is 
              available. Simply type EXIT to return to the door.

[Alt]-[H] -   Hang up on the user. Drops carrier and returns to the BBS.

[Alt]-[L] -   This key locks the user out of the BBS. It first hangs up 
              on the user, and then sets their security level to 0, to 
              prevent them from ever logging on again. This feature may 
              require use of the EXITINFO.BBS file, depending on what 
              system the door is running under.

[Alt]-[K] -   The "User Keyboard-Off" key allows the sysop to temporarily 
              prevent the user from typing anything on their keyboard. 
              This has no effect on the local keyboard, but causes the
              door to ignore any keystrokes from remote.

[Alt]-[N] -   The "Sysop Next" key, this function reserves the system for 
              use by the sysop after the user logs off, if the door is 
              running under an Apex or RA 1.00 or later system.

[Alt]-[D] -   "Drop to BBS" key. This function allows the sysop to close 
              the door and return the user to the BBS, without hanging up.

                                                      
                             USING THE DOOR
                             --------------
The door is menu-driven, and most of the functions are self-explanatory. A 
brief overview will be given here. To perform the action, press the hotkey
in the brackets <>.

<F>irst - Display the oldest record in the database. The toilet will flush
      and then display the record. It also displays the name of the person
      who posted it, when it was posted, and its position in the database
      (record x of y).
      
<N>ext  - Display the next record, oldest to newest. Again, the toilet will
      flush away the previous record.
      
<P>revious - Same as Next, but displays newest to oldest.

<L>ast  - Display the most recent record.

<E>nter - Enter a new record. You may type up to 8 lines of 24 characters 
      each. Just keep typing -- the text will word-wrap automatically.
      When done, press ENTER. You will be asked if you want to save.
      Press Y. 
      
      Then the door asks if you want to post anonymously. If you choose Y,
      the name of the person will only be displayed on the local screen,
      while the remote screen will display [Anonymous]. The local screen
      will also show the name in a different color to let the sysop know
      this was an anonymous post.
      
<D>elete - Removes a record. Generally, the sysop can delete any record,
      while callers can delete only those records they posted. However,
      if you don't want callers to be able to delete anything, see the
      "NoUserDelete" config file verb.
      
<R>edraw - Redraws the screen in case it gets messed up from line noise.

<C>hat  - Initiates a sysop page, requesting chat mode. See the config
      file for setting chat hours. Registration is necessary are disable
      chat.
      
<B>ack to BBS - Returns the caller to his active BBS session.

<G>oodbye - Drops carrier. This may require an EXITINFO.BBS style of
      door drop file to function. If EXITINFO.BBS is not available, this
      command will simply return the caller to the BBS.
 

                              REGISTRATION
                              ============
To Other Shareware Authors:

I will happily exchange registrations to any of my products, IF what you 
have interests me at all.  Netmail me with the specifics if interested.

(Not responsible for lost or misrouted mail!).

The key consists of a small file that resides in the same directory as
your game file (where TOILET.BBSis ). 

Benefits of Registration
------------------------

1) The door will only allow 30 total posts, and will not allow auto-delete
of old posts unless registered (see the "Wrap" and "AllPosts" config file
verbs for details).

2) You cannot disable paging or set paging hours unless registered.

3) The door will display -= UNREGISTERED =- when returning to the BBS until
you register. It also displays a shareware registration screen for about 5 
seconds every time someone uses the door.

4) You'll receive preferential support and free upgrades from the author.

5) You'll have peace of mind, knowing that you are supporting shareware.

How do you register?  Send $5 (US) cash, check or money order to:

                       Bruce Bowman
                       8364 S SR 39
                       Clayton, IN  46118

Allow 2 weeks for personal checks to clear. I'm told it's not a good idea 
to send cash via the mail, but I've never had problems with it. If you 
decide to do so, and the money gets ripped off, I will feel sorry for you 
but I won't waive your registration fee over it. Do NOT call the support 
BBS to register -- we have no registration doors, nor do we accept credit.
If I accepted credit I would have to pass the extra expense on to my
customers, which is not in keeping with DIRT CHEAP SOFTWARE's philosophy.

Accompany this with the form on the following page...or otherwise provide 
this information.  Registrations without this information WILL be ignored
(I will make a feeble attempt to contact you, and eventually tear up your
check).

It is also a VERY GOOD IDEA to send a copy of your drop files with your
registration. Since the door reads data from your drop files to determine
if the key will work, it is very important that both the sysop name and
the BBS name be provided EXACTLY as present in your drop files. If you
cannot guarantee this, you should send me your drop files...but rest 
assured that I will work with you to fix any problems you have with your 
key.

On occasion I have attempted to netmail certain individuals keys, only to 
get bad connects -- I simply cannot afford this. If your BBS is only online
during certain hours, let me know. If I get two bad connects trying to 
netmail a key, I will give up and put it on hold for you and notify you of 
this fact via routed netmail (which itself is not very reliable anymore).

NOTE:
Registered keyholders receive FREE UPGRADES when/if they become available.
You will have to check in though, since I don't plan to notify everyone of
an upgrade individually.

                            ----------------- 

TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS PROVIDED ONLY THROUGH EMAIL OR CALLING MY BBS! 

I have had people ask me to call them long-distance on my dime -- I simply 
don't make enough money on Toilet Stall to justify this. There seems to be 
a perception amongst the sysop community that door authors are getting rich
selling their doors, but the truth is the vast majority of sysops never
register them. I've spent a LOT of time programming this door; hopefully 
it will prove more lucrative than my other doors have so far.

To obtain support, you must call my BBS or send me email. If you choose to
call the BBS, you will obtain a full-access temporary account on your first
call. You can leave a message to the sysop at logoff, which I will get. In 
your message, please indicate some inexpensive (preferably free) means of 
contacting you. Once registered, I will happily help you with any problems 
you might have -- on my dime.

Q: The door can't find the data file, or it can't find my key even though
   I've registered. Help!
A: Run the door from the directory containing the game file and the key,
   or place the correct path in the config file under "DoorDir." The
   executable can be anywhere on your path. Make sure Toilet Stall knows
   where your drop files are from the "BBSDir" parameter. If your key is
   named something else, be sure to rename it to TOILET.KEY. Finally,
   try putting your system name and sysop name in the configuration file.
                  
   If it still does not recognize your key, you either did not provide
   the correct BBS and sysop names on your registration form, or your
   system is misconfigured so this information is not appearing in your
   drop files. Upload a copy of your drop files to the support BBS or via
   email to one of the listed addresses.
                                                         
Q: The game prints [2;4m brackets and other junk characters all over.
A: The door requires full ANSI graphics capability for best operation. 
   Exit the door and rectify the situation.
  
Q: The status line function keys don't work right -- they cause the door 
   to act peculiar and even lock up.
A: Have you defined the offending F-keys to launch a macro? Don't feel bad 
   -- I did this myself in DESQview, and was pretty bewildered for awhile!
                                  
Q: The file TOILET.BBS exists, but I still occasionally get a message from 
   the door saying "Error opening TOILET.BBS!"
A: The door will try 20 times to open the file over a 10-second interval. 
   If this fails, Toilet Stall gives up with an error. 

   You may be running out of file handles. Increase the number of FILES in 
   your CONFIG.SYS. 

   It is also possible that one task in a multi-tasking environment opened
   the file, and then crashed without closing it. If so, you will probably
   have to reboot to clear the error.

   This may also rarely happen during intensive disk activity in a multi-
   tasking environment (for example, when copying files to/from floppies). 
   Use a copy utility (like DVCOPY) that will properly release time slices 
   to your door.

   You *do* have DOS's SHARE.EXE loaded, don't you?

Q: Toilet Stall won't let me delete any records!
A: If your BBS drop files do not provide the sysop name, Toilet Stall cannot
   recognize you as the sysop, and therefore won't let you delete anything.
   Edit the config file to provide the door with your name, and you should
   then be able to delete records from the database. This isn't necessary
   for most drop file formats.

                          FUTURE OF TOILET STALL
                          ====================== 
                            
I have a few ideas that I may implement, but I do want to be careful that I
not make the door too elaborate without increasing the "fun factor!" 

Registered users get FREE UPGRADES.

While I think Toilet Stall is an excellent door even as it is, I would welcome 
any ideas on how it can be improved.
