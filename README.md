# Toilet Stall Redux -- BBS Door
## Origins
"Toilet Stall" was a BBS door programm written in C, released in 1995 by Bruce Bowman / Dirt Cheap Software. It was described as "multi-node grafitti wall door for most BBS Systems." It was $5 shareware and allowed users to "flush" messages down a toilet and even chat with the SysOp. 

## About
This program is meant to be an homage and spiritual successor to Bruce's program. None of the orignal art source and code is used. It utilizes a BBS door32.sys drop file and runs as a Linux console application.
